# MODERATE Platform API

This repository contains the HTTP API of the MODERATE platform, which serves as the public entry point for developers to programmatically interact with the data assets and services provided by the platform.

The API is implemented using the [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework. It does not include any authentication or authorization logic, as the API gateway, along with the Keycloak service, will handle that.
