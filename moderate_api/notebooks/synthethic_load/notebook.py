        ## Introduction

        üßë‚Äçüíª [**Link to the original repository: MODERATE-Project/Synthetic-Load-Profiles**](https://github.com/MODERATE-Project/Synthetic-Load-Profiles)

        Here, MODERATE presents a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate synthetic electricity load profiles. 
        The model learns from historical electricity consumption data to create synthetic profiles, which can be useful for energy analysis, 
        grid simulations, and privacy-preserving data sharing. The repository provides two methods for training the model:

        1. Marimo notebook: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading data and configuring settings.
        2. Python script: Allows for more customization and supports larger datasets.

        The present notebook does not demonstrate GAN training but provides a simple example of inference using a pre-trained model 
        trained on publicly available open data. 
        To train your own model and fine-tune it to your needs, please refer to the original repository.
